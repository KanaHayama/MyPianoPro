# About

A course project for Programmable Logic Device and Hardware course in 2015 when I was a junior.

This is a FPGA programming course project, playing a complete piano song with multiple buzzers to creates chord effects.

# Details

The course project requires students to implement an FPGA project on their own and graded by the TA based on difficulty.

This project plays 風のアルペジオ.
The music is hard-coded using a self-defined format.

This is a work before I started using Github.
I thought this project was lost due to failed to restore back up data after one laptop system reinstall.
(I lost a lot of my interesting projects o(TヘTo))
I just found it in one of my old USB stick by chance, so now I archive it using Github.
